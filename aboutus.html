      <h2>About Us:</h2>
      <p>Damania Hospital Trust, Gandevi is a non profit organization. The trust was formed by the foresighted and outstanding few Kshatriya members of town Gandevi in Navsari district with an intension to provide medical services at subsidized rates to the economically less privileged people without considering casts, creed, sex or religion of Gandevi Taluka and its surrounding villages.</p>

      <p>The trust made a humble beginning by creating N.J. Damania Clinic in a one small room to serve patients in 1991. As time passed, the demand for the service from the patients increased. The trust converted the Clinic into N.J. Damania Sarvajanic Hospital in 1998 with the following objectives..</p>
   	  
      <h3>Objectives:</h3>
